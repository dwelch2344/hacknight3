# hacknight3 - Virtual Reality! 

Iron Chef style - the secret ingredient is VR. React 360, Unity, whatever. Go make something cool.

Grading criteria:
 1. Does it run on your box?
 2. Does it run on device?
 3. Can it do a thing? 
 4. Can it do a thing with some remote service? 
 5. How creative is it? 
 6. How bad did you cheat / copy / use previous work? 
 7. Biases. Lots of biases. 


### React 360
